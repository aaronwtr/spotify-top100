# Spotify Top 100 Generator 
The following scripts parses through your own playlist(s) and extracts the most popular songs based on popularity data from Spotify and Genius. If you want to extract the 100 (or any other number) most popular tracks from your favorite playlist, this script can help you out! A few modifications are needed to make it work in your personal environment.

# Initialization 
The first step necessary is to make an account that links your Spotify account to a developer account. This can be done through the following link: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/. This account will provide you with a client id and a client key. Both are necessary to allow the program to run and extract data from your personal Spotify account within the limitations set by Spotify. 

# Help
If you need any further help or assistance while running the code, or if you have feedback, I would love to hear it. Contact me via email: aaronwenteler@gmail.com
